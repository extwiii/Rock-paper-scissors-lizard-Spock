# Rock-paper-scissors-lizard-Spock template


# The key idea of this program is to equate the strings
# "rock", "paper", "scissors", "lizard", "Spock" to numbers
# as follows:
#
# 0 - rock
# 1 - Spock
# 2 - paper
# 3 - lizard
# 4 - scissors

# helper functions

def name_to_number(name):
    # delete the following pass statement and fill in your code below
    pass

    # convert name to number using if/elif/else
    # don't forget to return the result!


def number_to_name(number):
    # delete the following pass statement and fill in your code below
    pass

    # convert number to a name using if/elif/else
    # don't forget to return the result!


def rpsls(player_choice):
    # delete the following pass statement and fill in your code below
    pass

    # print a blank line to separate consecutive games

    # print out the message for the player's choice

    # convert the player's choice to player_number using the function name_to_number()

    # compute random guess for comp_number using random.randrange()

    # convert comp_number to comp_choice using the function number_to_name()

    # print out the message for computer's choice

    # compute difference of comp_number and player_number modulo five

    # use if/elif/else to determine winner, print winner message


# test your code - THESE CALLS MUST BE PRESENT IN YOUR SUBMITTED CODE
